<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><h1>ðŸŽ¶Overture: Composing My Code</h1>
Iâ€™m Fizza N., a passionate technologist, author, and creative problem solver with a keen interest in building meaningful 
digital experiences. I blend technical precision with empathetic innovation to craft solutions that are not just functional,
but purposeful. Whether it's software, social impact projects, or storytelling, I thrive at the intersection of logic and
creativity.</p>
<br/>

<p><h1>ðŸ”§Core Harmony: The Architecture of Me</h1>
I am currently exploring and developing my skills across diverse domains in technology and innovation. My journey so far 
has been marked by a strong commitment to impactful work, a relentless pursuit of learning, and a consistent drive to 
contribute meaningfully to the world around me.
Over the years, Iâ€™ve engaged in a wide range of academic and creative projects. One of my most notable accomplishments
is â€œSafe Haven App",that detects domestic abuse, provides instant SOS alerts, connects users to legal aid, and finds safe 
housing- al with stealth mode and multilingual voice support. Designed for middle-class and rural users, 
it uses AI voice/NLP detection, chatbots, and location tracking to offer real-time protection and empowerment,
especially for women and vulnerable individuals that advanced to the jury level in MANTHAN, a national-level innovation
challenge.This project demonstrated not only my engineering mindset but also my ability to think out-of-the-box 
and develop practical solutions with creative design.

As an author, I have published two books, showcasing my ability to communicate ideas, emotions, and stories
effectively â€” blending imagination with authenticity. These works reflect my creative identity beyond technology.

<p><h1>ðŸŒŒResonance: The Values I Echo</h1>
I believe that innovation is most powerful when it is inclusive, empathetic, and human-centered. Technology should
serve as a bridge â€” not just between systems, but between people, ideas, and possibilities. I strive to create
 solutions that are not only intelligent but also kind.
<br/>
For me, growth is rooted in curiosity and courage â€” the courage to question, explore, and create without fear 
of imperfection. I see every project as a reflection of not just my skills, but my values: integrity, 
creativity, and purpose.
<br/>
In every step forward, I aim to contribute to a world where technology uplifts lives, stories inspire action, 
and collaboration drives progress.
